# The-Wrath-of-God
The holy books are often said to be full of hate. This project uses sentiment analysis to show how they are not necessarily more negative than others, but rather more emotional. As with the drinking priest in the 1972 film The Wrath of God, this means they can be prone to significant anger as well as other more positive emotions.
